> How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories are a very important part of Agile that helps us understand user needs. Through direct canvasing of the users, we are able to learn what the user wants to be able to do with the program and implement accordingly.

> How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Originally, I found myself developing programs through a waterfall approach. I would plan out everything I wanted my program to do at the beginning, then stick to that idea through completion. However, after finishing I would often find new things I wanted to implement that I did not plan my program around, sometimes requiring extensive amounts of reworking the code. Since learning about Agile, one thing I will definitely implement more is the idea of the sprint. I can still outline at the beginning what I would like, however instead of working until the final program is complete, I can develop it in modules, review, and then decide if there's anything new or different I would like to do with it.

> What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

There are many aspects that make a good team member in software development. The ability to communicate is especially important, as in a team setting, one must be able to discuss with their other teammates the software that they are developing, asking questions and helping each other out through the process. Another important aspect is a willingness to learn. There are advances made in software development all the time, being set in one's ways about it would just slow yourself and your team down.
