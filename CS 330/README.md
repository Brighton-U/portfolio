> How do I approach designing software?

When designing software, I like to gather all the information I can regarding what is required, what we call user requirements. This enables me to understand what it is that I need to code, how I can break it up and make my code more modular and robust in the long run, as well as better understand the program.

> How do I approach developing programs?

In previous courses, I learned about the software design lifecycle and iterative releases. This course was a basic hands on approach to this concept by having us iteratively release updates to our program that would become our final project throughout the semester. It has taught me that not everything has to be done and completed immediately, that small portions of the project can be completed and released over time. This also allowed me to further develop my knowledge in the libraries we used throughout the project to gain a better understanding and better implement the features that were required.

> How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Considering my goal is to be a software developer or a video game programmer, computer science will 100% help me meet my goals. It has already taught me a lot about different programming languages, the software design lifecycle, as well as software automation and testing.
