> How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

By statically reviewing and manually testing my code routinely, I can catch bugs early as well as gain a deeper understanding of my work. Through the use of automated testing libraries, such as JUnit, I can further enhance the functionality and security of my programs by writing test cases to ensure each individual component of the system works as well as when they are integrated with each other. I can also have my code peer reviewed and tested to eliminate any kind of bias I may have in my code.

> How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs are important to consider when writing a program. I analyze the needs of the user, break it up into pieces, and then write code for what is needed. When considering user needs, it is also important to consider whether they are functional or nonfunctional requirements. The functional requirements should be prioritized over the nonfunctional, as they are what makes the program what it is, while the nonfunctional requirements increase the user's enjoyment with the system overall.

> How do I approach designing software?

This course has taught me that not only is it important to know how to write code, it is also important to write functional and secure code as well as thoroughly testing it. It also taught me the importance of understanding the code and how each part integrates with each other in the system. Using this knowledge, I will continue to enhance my code as well as begin integrating software automation in order to produce more robust and secure programs.
