> Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app I developed was an inventory app. The requirements were that users have the ability to login (as well as signing up in the absence of an existing account), displaying the inventory (which could be edited to add, update, or remove items), a notification system, and permission requests. This app was targeted towards warehouse managers, with its goal being to streamline their inventory process allowing them ease of access to items within their warehouse(s) while providing them crucial notifications on low or out of stock items.

> What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The screens that were essential to this app were the login screen, the sign up screen, the inventory screen, and the permission request screen. I designed my UI to be clean and streamlined, with only the essential functions implemented on their associated screen. I also kept navigation straightforward so as not to confuse the user.

> How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

This app was programmed modularly and encapsulated, with each system broken down into separate classes, allowing for the system to be more easily documented, understood, and updated. For example, the code that handles the SQLite database is separated into a class that handles the creation of the databases and several classes that handle communication with these databases. This not only keeps things organized but also allows the app to be updated in certain areas more easily.

> How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

Testing was performed throughout the development process of the app. I would focus on one feature, implement it, then test it to ensure that it functioned correctly before moving on to the next feature. I also ensured that each of the different components of the app worked together and did not cause any issues. This process was important for ensuring that the app met the user's needs while being bug free.

> Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I have thus far been primarily focused on backend programming, so actually drawing up and designing a UI for an app was a new experience for me. I also had very little experience with Android Studio going into this course. These were challenges that I had to overcome by not only getting hands on experience with Android Studio but also essentially placing myself in the role of the user and designing the app how I would like it to look if I had downloaded it to my device.

> In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I was most successful in developing the backend portion of the application, as it is what I am most comfortable with. Researching how to deploy a local database and connect to it was an interesting topic. I also feel that my knowledge and skill in UI design has increased dramatically throughout this course and I will continue to improve this newly learned skill throughout my career.
