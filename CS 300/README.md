> What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problems we explored were the benefits and trade-offs of various data structures (vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees), their applications, and which data structure was the most optimal for loading, sorting, displaying, and searching a list of courses along with their prerequisites from a file.

> How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

We first approached this problem by learning about the various data structures, what their average speeds and limitations were, and how they were best applied. It was important to understand this information about the data structures as each has their own application. Data that is stable, is not accessed very often, or does not require speed for access and modification can be stored differently from volatile data that needs to be accessed quickly and frequently.

> How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Google is your friend. A lot of YouTube was watched. Exploring solutions on StackOverflow also proved very useful.

> How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project educated me on the structure of a binary search tree and the course overall widened by perspective on data structures in general. It also educated me on determining the efficiency of my programming through the use of big O notation and average/worst-case runtimes. Pseudocode is not something I used often previously and my work throughout this course has greatly increased my use and understanding of its functionality.

> How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

All of my courses continue to teach me the importance of commenting your code.
