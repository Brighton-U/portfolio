> Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was commissioned by Liam, the owner of DriverPass. The purpose of DriverPass is to provide individuals the ability to accelerate their driver's education through online classes, practice tests, and scheduled driving lessons. The idea was that by providing this service, the odds of individuals passing their driver's test would increase. The client asked for the DriverPass system to be developed as a cloud-based service accessible through web browsers to increase accessiblity.

> What did you do particularly well?

What I did particularly well was designing different types of UML diagrams for the system. I broke down aspects of the system into modules, defined core entities and relationships, and included appropriate attributes. I also demonstrated logical progression through certain functionalities of the system.

> If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

One thing I could improve upon is the system design document. When I originally wrote it, I did not fully understand the concept of cloud-based services. If I were to improve it, I would research more deeply into cloud-based services and write more extensively on the benefits of having the DriverPass system hosted on one.

> How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

I first started by carefully reviewing the interview transcript, which provided input from the client on what they wanted and expected their system to do. I then took these requirements and broke them down to their base level, defining functional and nonfunctional requirements, as well as the relationships these requirements have with the different users of the system. I then designed different types of diagrams to demonstrate the logical flow of data throughout the system. It is important to consider a user's needs when designing software as it is designed to solve their problems and make their life easier. By taking into consideration their needs, the software can be better equipped to fulfill its purpose through thoughtful and useful functionalities.

> How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software, I first gather as much critical information as I can from the client to clearly define the needs of the system. I then take and interpret this information into visual models that represent the functionalities of the system, the components of the system, and how the system should behave and respond. I take care to ensure that all aspects of the system are clearly designed and the logical flow of data is easy to understand. Going forward, I will incorporate more visual models into my system design, as these help a programmer understand the system and are more easily translated directly into functional code.
