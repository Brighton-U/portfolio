**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
In this project, we were tasked with creating an inventory viewer of grocery items that were purchased. The items were accounted for in the file by purchase history. Due to this, there were a lot of repeat items in the list and it was not very readable or searchable. The program parsed the file, grouped the same items together, and made it both searchable and easily viewable by showing the number of each item purchased either as a number or as a histogram.
