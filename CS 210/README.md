> Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

In this project, we were tasked with creating an inventory viewer of grocery items that were purchased. The items were accounted for in the file by purchase history. Due to this, there were a lot of repeat items in the list and it was not very readable or searchable. The program parsed the file, grouped the same items together, and made it both searchable and easily viewable by showing the number of each item purchased either as a number or as a histogram.

> What did you do particularly well?

I believe that I was very effective at commenting my code to ensure it was readable. I also tried to name my variables and functions so it would be easy to understand what their purpose was. I also think I did particularly well at modulating my code through headers and classes to ensure the main file was as clean as possible.

> Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

There are several enhancements that could be made to the code. Being able to enter a file path for the input and output files would be good. The ability to enter a partial search term would also probably be useful.

> Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Writing the linked list and node classes for the program was a little challenging. Aside from the course book, I also looked at Stack Overflow and geeksforgeeks for assistance.

> What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Other than just advancing my knowledge of C++, I think that pointers and memory management were important skills learned from this project.

> How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I used a comment format for the first time that can help with automation and made distinct header and class files so that the project could be better maintained and updated.
