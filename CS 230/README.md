> Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, are the developers of the mobile application game _Draw It or Lose It_. They requested that a web-based system be developed for their game to allow users to play through their web browsers on many different clients, including desktop and mobile devices.

> What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I was effective at the evaluation phase of the document, understanding the functionality and differences of various systems. I was able to clearly define benefits and limitations of each system, what each system would be best suited for, and ultimately draw a conclusion on the recommended system for the web-based service.

> What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The requirement phase of the document was especially useful as it clearly defined what the system needed to do, which aided further in the development of visual models. These visual models are then more easily translated directly to code.

> If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

One section that could be improved upon is the recommendations section. While I did a particuarly good job defining why a Linux-based platform would be optimal, I could have researched Linux flavors available and made a determination on what particular flavor of Linux to use for the server side of _Draw It or Lose It_.

> How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

I began by analyzing the description of The Gaming Room's current game functionality and breaking it down into different components. I then translated these components into business and technical requirements, which aided in the development of visual models and ultimately making a recommendation based on evaluation of needs. It is important to consider user's needs when designing as the systme is designed for them. The software should be able to meet the user needs and expected functionality. By taking into considerating the user's needs, a software designer can adequately ensure that the software includes functionality that will be useful to the user for solving their problems and making their lives easier.

> How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing software by obtaining and reviewing the core functionality of the current design to determine business and technical requirements, which were then used to identify design restraints and define visual models. After a thorough evaluation process using these requirements, I was able to draw a conclusion on the best platform for the system. Going forward I will definitely incorporate the evaluation of different systems to better determine what systems are optimal for the development of software and server hosting.
